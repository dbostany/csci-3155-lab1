2. Scala Basics: Binding and Scope. For each the following uses of names, give the line where
that name is bound. Briefly explain your reasoning (in no more than 1â€“2 sentences).

    (a) Consider the following Scala code.

```Scala
    1   val pi = 3.14
    2   def circumference(r: Double): Double = {
    3     val pi = 3.14159
    4     2.0 * pi * r
    5   }
    6   def area(r: Double): Double =
    7     pi * r * r
```
##### The use of pi at line 4 is bound at which line?
    - The pi at line 4 is bound by the pi at line 3 because it is declared within the same scope. The pi on line 1 is out of scope.

##### The use of pi at line 7 is bound at which line?
    - The pi at line 7 is bound at line 1 because it is used and defined outside of the scope of circumference.

```Scala
1       val x = 3
2       def f(x: Int): Int =
3           x match {
4               case 0 => 0
5               case x => {
6                   val y = x + 1
7                   ({
8                       val x = y + 1
9                       y
10                  } * f(x - 1))
11              }
12          }
13      val y = x + f(x)
```

##### The use of x at line 3 is bound at which line?
- x at line 3 is bound on line 2 where x is passed into function f as a parameter.

##### The use of x at line 6 is bound at which line?
- x at line 6 is bound on line 5 because it can only be called on within 'case x'.

##### The use of x at line 10 is bound at which line?
- x at line 10 is also bound by line 5 because they're in the same scope. The closing bracket on line 10 closes off the higher level scope just before using x. 

##### The use of x at line 13 is bound at which line?
- x at line 13 is bound on line 1 because it's the only definition of x in the global scope.

##### 3. Scala Basics: Typing. In the following, I have left off the return type of function g. The body of is well-typed if we can come up with a valid return type. Is the body of g well-typed?

```Scala
1   def g(x: Int) = {
2       val (a, b) = (1, (x, 3))
3       if (x = 0) (b, 1) else (b, a + 2)
4   }
```
- The body of g is well typed if the function returns the same type consistently. g is well typed because no matter the value of x, g returns a value of type tuple: ((int, int) int). The name 'a' is of type int and 'b' is of type (int, int).

        (b, 1): ((int, int) int) because
            b: (int, int) because
                (x, 3): (int, int) because
                    x: int
                    3: int
            1: int

        (b, a + 2): ((int, int) int) because
            b: (int, int) because
                (x, 3): (int, int) because
                    x: int
                    3: int
            a + 2: int because
                a: int
                2: int
