1. Feedback. Complete the survey linked from the moodle after completing this assignment.
Any non-empty answer will receive full credit.

2. Scala Basics: Binding and Scope. For each the following uses of names, give the line where
that name is bound. Briefly explain your reasoning (in no more than 1â€“2 sentences).

    (a) Consider the following Scala code.

```Scala
    1   val pi = 3.14
    2   def circumference(r: Double): Double = {
    3     val pi = 3.14159
    4     2.0 * pi * r
    5   }
    6   def area(r: Double): Double =
    7     pi * r * r
```
##### The use of pi at line 4 is bound at which line?
    - The pi at line 4 is bound by the pi at line 3 because it is declared within the same scope. The pi on line 1 is out of scope.

##### The use of pi at line 7 is bound at which line?
    - The pi at line 7 is bound at line 1 because it is used and defined outside of the scope of circumference.

    1       val x = 3
    2       def f(x: Int): Int =
    3           x match {
    4               case 0 => 0
    5               case x=> {
    6                   val y = x + 1
    7                   ({
    8                       val x = y + 1
    9                       y
    10                  } * f(x - 1))
    11              }
    12          }
    13      val y = x + f(x)

##### The use of x at line 3 is bound at which line?
- x at line 3 is bound on line 2 where x is passed into function f as a parameter.

##### The use of x at line 6 is bound at which line?
- 

##### The use of x at line 10 is bound at which line?

##### The use of x at line 13 is bound at which line?
