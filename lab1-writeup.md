1. Feedback. Complete the survey linked from the moodle after completing this assignment.
Any non-empty answer will receive full credit.

2. Scala Basics: Binding and Scope. For each the following uses of names, give the line where
that name is bound. Briefly explain your reasoning (in no more than 1â€“2 sentences).

    (a) Consider the following Scala code.

```Scala
    1   val pi = 3.14
    2   def circumference(r: Double): Double = {
    3     val pi = 3.14159
    4     2.0 * pi * r
    5   }
    6   def area(r: Double): Double =
    7     pi * r * r
```
### The use of pi at line 4 is bound at which line?
    - The pi at line 4 is bound by the pi at line 3 because it is declared within the same scope. The pi on line 1 is out of scope.
